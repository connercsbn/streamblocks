make calendar events 90% opacity?
make calendar scrollbar better / theme it
setting to fix start and end times of calendar

MVP
1. in addition to checking schedule, also check if they're live currently. add this to calendar as well

FUTURE UPDATES
1. embedded video
2. thing that tells you how soon until streamer is live again ("we don't maybe need that but maybe we do")
3. overlap settings: (overlap completely, overlap a little) | (overlap based on streamer | overlap to show as much of calendar as possible)


limited color pallette (kaitlyn makes it?)

tabs

when overlapping, click to show lightbox of overlapping events separately, where you can x any of them out, which reuslts in the original event being grayed out or low opacity or something, but you can click to get it to come back somehow

add ability to edit schedules

manually schedules (high priority)

down the line, maybe add conflict resolving system
